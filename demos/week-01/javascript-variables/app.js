// here I am putting the string "Hello world" into the console
console.log("Hello world");

// VARIABLES

// a variable is a "bucket" that we can put information into
// each variable declaration looks like a setence
// hey JS, let my name be equal to Tim please
let myName = "Tim";

// we can use variables over and over again
console.log(myName); // notice how we don't put "" around the variable name
console.log("myName"); // here JavaScript just gives us the string "myName", not the variables value
