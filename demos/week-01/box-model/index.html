    <div class="box">hi, I'm 180x180</div>
    <p>
      Despite the fact that we have given the box a width and height of 140px,
      it is much larger because it has been given a border and padding (the
      margin did not increase its size)
    </p>

    <div class="box box-sized">hi, I'm 140x140</div>
    <p>This code has the <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> css rule</p>
    <p>
      This means that the size we give it will include the padding and border
    </p>
    <p>
      In BOTH cases, the margin, just moves the boxes around and has NO impact
      on the size.
