    <h1>Images, Audio & Video</h1>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>img tags require the src attribute to tell it where to get the image</p>
    <p>
      We can use external images in the src (hosted on somebody elses website)
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://techeducators.co.uk/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Fstaff%2Fjeztech.png&w=640&q=75"
      width="300"
      alt="Jez's face a little too close for comfort"
    />
    <p>Or we can download the images to our own project and use that</p>
    <p>We can even do gifs!</p>
    <img
      src="./assets/images/the-weekend.gif"
      alt="daniel craig saying its the weekend"
    />
    <p>
      The two benefits of using images your have saved are its quicker, and if
      the original owner takes their image down, you won't have it any more
    </p>
    <p>
      They will work without an alt tag, but if you do that you're a bad person.
      Put alt tags on your image
    </p>
    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>Audio tags work a LOT like img tags, but, they are not self closing.</p>
    <audio src="./assets/audio/windows-tone.mp3" controls loop></audio>
    <p>
      controls shows the controls, loop makes it loop, autoplay should be
      illegal don't do it (it also probably won't work on modern browsers)
    </p>
    <h2>Video</h2>
    <video
      src="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
      poster="./assets/images/bbb.png"
      width="1500"
      controls
      autoplay
      muted
      loop
    ></video>
  </body>
