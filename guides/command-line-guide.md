There are a few command line er - comamnds you'll use often throughout this course:

For now -

If you see a `~` it means you're in the ROOT directory. (ROOT directory) meaning the base of the tree of your folder structure. (If you dont have omyzsh installed, you may see your username and ROOT here instead.)

`ls` - this will list all the folders/files in the current directory you're on.

`open .` - for macbooks, this will open the finder in your current location

`explorer.exe .` - for windows, this will open the file explorer in your current location

`cd foldername` - replace foldername with the name of the folder you'd like to move into. cd means change directory - you may see folders be refered to as directories at times.

`cd ..` - cd .. will move you back up a level. EG, if you've cd'd into folder 2 (that was inside folder 1) after being in folder 1, cd .. will move you back into folder 1.

`code .` - will open vsCode in the current directory.

`mkdir foldername` - will make a folder in your current location

`touch filename.fileextension` - will make a file in your current location. eg `touch index.html` you can also chain together making files with one touch command `touch index.html style.css app.js` will create three files.

`pwd` - print working directory. Logs to the terminal your current fielepath.
